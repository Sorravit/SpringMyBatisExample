# Spring Boot MyBatis Example

This project is a simple showcase of using MyBatis with Spring Boot. It demonstrates how to use both annotation-based and XML-based MyBatis mappings for basic CRUD operations on a `User` entity.

## Features
- Create a user (auto-generated ID)
- Update a user's name (XML mapping)
- List all users
- Get a specific user by ID
- Delete all users

## Database
- The database schema is automatically created on application startup using `schema.sql`.
- The user ID is auto-generated by MySQL and will be populated in the response after successful creation.

## Example Usage

### Create User
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "John Doe", "age": 30}'
```

### Update User Name
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/users/1/name \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d 'New Name'
```

### List All Users
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/users
```

### Get User by ID
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/users/1
```

### Delete All Users
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/users
```

## Notes
- The project uses both annotation-based and XML-based MyBatis mappings to showcase different approaches.
